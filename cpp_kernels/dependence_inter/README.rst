Loop Dependency Inter (C)
=========================

This Example demonstrates the HLS pragma 'DEPENDENCE'.Using 'DEPENDENCE' pragma, user can provide additional dependency details to the compiler by specifying if the dependency in consecutive loop iterations on buffer is true/false, which allows the compiler to perform unrolling/pipelining to get better performance.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Inter Dependence

**KEYWORDS:** DEPENDENCE, inter, WAR

EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
------------------

Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :

::

   zc702

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/vconv.cpp
   src/vconv.h
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./host <vconv XCLBIN>

COMMANDS FOR WINDOWS FLOW
-------------------------

Once the environment has been configured, run the following commands :

::

   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=<set xilinx xrt path> -DOCL_ROOT=<set ocl root path>
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install

   For Example : 
   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=C:\Xilinx\XRT -DOCL_ROOT=C:\Xilinx\XRT\ext
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install
